Information Retrieval and Text Processing Project
This repository contains my work from the Information Retrieval and Text Processing course. The project focuses on applying various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, lemmatization, sentiment analysis, and text cleaning. The project uses powerful NLP tools such as BERT, Word2Vec (W2V), and Hebpipe.
